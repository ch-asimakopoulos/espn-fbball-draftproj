# espn-fbball-draftproj

This repo lets you project who will win your Rotisserie ESPN Fantasy Basketball league, based on the draft you did and ESPN's player projections.  

Highly customizable, using the espn_config.ts file.

To get your draft data input for the espn_config.ts file visit https://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/fba/seasons/2020/segments/0/leagues/XXXXXX?view=mDraftDetail&view=mSettings&view=mTeam&view=modular&view=mNav

You should replace XXXXXX with your league number!


To run compile the typescript files and run the .js output file. 

Check the results on your console!
